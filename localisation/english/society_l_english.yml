An Institute, to teach our children the hard lessons of empire by subjecting them to terrible conditions and tasks. The Institute would be open to any Gold children of sufficient ability, and would reward its victors with marks to denote their new standing.

They call for extermination, and the wiping of their genome from the databanks.\n\nOthers instead propose an alternate remedy: reducing the robustness of the Obsidians to warmer climes, stripping them of their technology, and installing a new religion amongst them that would prevent them from ever rising again.

These lead to their prices declining on stock markets, which simultaneously underwent both dramatic shorting by investors and malfunctions within many automated trading algorithms. The result was catastrophic, with bank failures and corporate bankruptcies. Total income tax revenues are expected to be down 8% next quarter.\n\nIts still not clear which traders on the floor were forewarned or even instigators, but a minority made a fortune today. Most did not. Your analysts agree some of this money will go straight to the Sons, who claimed responsibility for the sabotage on the HoloNet ten minutes before it happened."

Gold talks quietly to Gold about reform, Grey to Grey about justice, and Red to Red about rights. The media seeks to quiet the mutterings but every story about it they run has the oppsoite effect, fanning the flames.

After much inter-house conflict, it appears Darrow left his House and founded his own tribe, before defeating several other Houses.\n\nHe then proceeded to assault and defeat the game's referees, taking their weapons and using them to defeat the remaining contestants. Details remain unclear, but it appears this was probably a response to cheating on behalf of the referees, and rumours abound of bribery.\n\nDespite the unusual circumstances, there can be no question of failing to give Darrow the highest honours, as his victory exemplifies the best merits of Gold: ruthlessness and lateral thinking. Especially since he used his control of the referee's equipment to manipulate the record of the game to paint him and his followers in a flattering light."

The final such gathering is hosted by the Sovereign, and it is a small informal dinner that celebrates the entry of the dozen or so best new leaders into the upper echelons of Gold society.\n\nThis year the guest of honour is Darrow au Andromedus, who has risen from a family name of little to no account to become one of the brightest rising stars in the Society. He has excelled at duelling, naval and ground combat, and has scored extraordinarily high on every test he has taken.

Such low level conflicts between your underlings are continual, and normally beneath your notice, but here sadly it appears to have deprived you of a useful tool. Darrow died shortly after seizing control of the planet in question, he was betrayed by a ally in the middle of his own victory parade."

The process was clearly horrific, but worse yet is the claim made by its releasers that the Sons of Ares did this to insert a sleeper agent into the Society.\n\nThe video in question has been watched almost a billion times already, despite thorough scrubbing to remove it from the Net. It is now almost common knowledge the Darrow au Andromedus, Hero of Mars, was not only a Red but a Son of Ares and a traitor. The effect on the morale of Gold, on the military, and on subversives, is incalculable."

Beside him stands Ares himself, helmeted. Clearly reports of Darrow's death have been exaggerated: presumably he has escaped imprisonment at the hands of one of his political enemies with Ares' help. The presence of two enemies of the Society so close to Luna is galling.\n\nThe speech Darrow gives is about justice, equality, revolution. An open call to every colour to overthrow Gold, and thanks to Ares' hackers it goes out to every planet in the Society. We must wait to see who responds."
